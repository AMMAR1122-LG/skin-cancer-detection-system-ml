# Skin Cancer Detection System 🧬🖼️

A Machine Learning-powered web application to detect skin cancer from dermatological images. It classifies lesions as **Benign** or **Malignant**, aiding early diagnosis and prevention. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit, the system provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for testing real-time predictions.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**: Trained on a dermatology image dataset (e.g., HAM10000).
- 📊 **High Accuracy**: Utilizes CNN-based classification with optimized training.
- 🌐 **Streamlit Interface**: Clean web UI for uploading and testing images.
- 🖼️ **Visual Feedback**: Real-time image prediction with class probability.
- 📁 **Modular Codebase**: Separated scripts for data preprocessing, training, and deployment.
